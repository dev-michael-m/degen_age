    text: `Eons ago, Elves, Knights, Wizards, and Goblins all thrived together within the metaverse. All was great until the Mighty Storm of the Brakkens. Nasty creatures the Brakkens were. Some say the Brakkens were constructed to bring destruction among the four factions.

It was once said that the tower of Raeyn held ancient scripts of the Creators. Atop the tower, a young mage attempted a tracing spell, but nothing happened. He tried again, and again, and again.

“Rats!” He yelled out, unintentionally throwing the spell book down the tower. 

When suddenly, the spell took hold. The trail of the spell pursued the book as it descended into a pit of darkness. 

“Great…”.
    
The young mage used his magic to lower himself down to the bottom of the tower. Touching down on the tower floor, he carefully picked up the spell book. 

When out of the shadows a voice spoke, “Are you here to finally slay me down?”. 

The young mage couldn't comprehend where the voice was coming from. 

“Well…are you still there?”, the voice said. 

The young mage cast a spell to illuminate the surrounding area. An enormous creature stood before him. One he had never seen before. It was magnificent. 

Finding his voice the young mage asked, “Who are you, and what are you hiding from?”. 

“It's a long story”, the creature explained…
    
A few days passed, and the young mage had finally arrived back to the citadel. The aura around him was different. Later that night, he gathered the leaders of the four factions in the bottom of the citadel. A huge crystal could be seen levitating in the middle of the room.
    
The young mage explained to them why they were all gathered together. And one by one, the leaders placed their hands on the face of the crystal. The crystal began to whir and glow ever brighter. As the young mage began chanting, sparks and bolts of light were emitted from the crystal.
    
Suddenly the crystal let out an enormous blast that tossed the leaders viliantly against the walls. Everything had gone dark. A massive wave of energy had escaped through the citadel.  The young mage bolted up the stairs to the top of the citadel. Faint screams could be heard coming from within the city's walls. Smoke and flames engulfed the city. The young mage couldn't comprehend what had happened. 

“I swore I did it right, unless. . .”.  

He soon realized the ancient power he had just unleashed.
    
A noise could be heard from behind him.  A shadowy figure had come barreling towards him.  Before he could jump out of the way, he was knocked unconscious and lay silent on the top of the citadel.
    
The young mage woke up with a gasp, expecting to see the entire world turned to ash. To his surprise everything seemed to still be intact.  

“But I swear I saw…”.  

It must have been a dream, but it seemed so real.
    
After taking some time to rest, he decided to rush down to the bottom of the citadel to ensure the crystal was still there.  

This is where our story begins…

    text: `The lost lands of Brakkaria were only a myth until the Brakkens resurfaced. A mystical land that contained many riches and power. A sacred place created from floating islands in the sky. A beautiful civilization with no care in the world. 

All was great in Brakkaria until greed flooded the lands. Many leaders from far away lands wanted their power and riches for themselves. Destruction plagued Brakkaria until the leader of the Brakkarian army finally had enough. He brought down his mighty hammer, and took out the parasitic leaders one by one. 
    
Outraged by this invasive act, the Brakkarian leader invaded their rival's land, and took them by force. Brakkaria then grew ever larger. His dominance and brave leadership over these lands gave the residents more confidence and insurance over their leader's power.  Brakkaria was now thriving more than ever, and no one dared to tempt their might ever again. 
    
In the dungeon of one of the besieged strongholds, a man lay shackled inside a steel cage with some strange markings engraved on it.  The Brakkarian leader was told this man held knowledge to an ancient power, and that he must meet with him at once.  
    
As he approached the cage, a voice spoke, “It seems the prophecy has begun.  You will become a very powerful and mystic being”. 
    
The Brakkarian leader studied the man. 
    
“Prophecy? Mystic being? Who are you and why do you say such things?”, he said.
    
“I'm not from this plane of existence. I'm merely an ancient spectacle from a distant land.”, the man replied.
    
“The prophecy tells of one true leader.  One to rule them all.  No more war, just peace.”
    
“It says so in that book on the table over there.”, he said as he gestured towards a small wooden table in the corner of the dungeon.
    
The Brakkarian leader walked over and gingerly picked up the book. The title was faded and unreadable. He opened up the book and began to read. At that moment, the engraved symbols on the cage disappeared, and the prisoner's chains unlocked. 
    
“Ahh, that's better. Now let's discuss this prophecy.”

    Long before in the land of the Elves, there was a young elf with dreams. Dreams of exploration and power. He lived in a palace with his siblings and parents. He was royalty, a prince with little to no freedom to explore. He was third in line right after his two brothers. 

For a few weeks now, the adventurous prince had been sneaking out of the palace walls and into the outer villages. Always in a disguise, he became aware of a plot to overthrow the palace and replace the rulers with new ones. Instead of warning his so-called “family”, he joined the group and disclosed to them secret passageways into the palace.
 
The night was bright with the two moons at full shine. It was time for the rebellion to begin. The prince's identity was known as a merchant from within the palace walls. Even if his real identity was revealed, he would have no remorse. 

During his time within the outer villages, he's seen what poor management can do to a kingdom. Stealing from the lesser elves, slaughtering the families that couldn't afford to pay their living fees. Using the kingdom's armies for private use.  He knew if he didn't act now, the outer villages would continue to suffer. 

He finally had enough of his family's cruelty.  With the rebellious group growing even larger, he knew he must lead the charge…
	
Showing no mercy, he decimated each guard that stood in his way towards the palace. He moved swiftly like a shadow, no sound, only silence. Hiding each body as they moved along.  Inching closer to his parents' room, the prince noticed his brother's bodies had already been mutilated and brutalized. 

“They weren't meant to be touched", he whispered.

Upon reaching his parents' room, he could hear screaming coming from within. Slowly opening the door he noticed that his father was in a drunken stupor pointing a sword at his mother. His mother was backed up against a wall with blood dripping from her left arm. 

“The son I want to rule has been corrupted with your stupid fairy tails and lies. I will not have you corrupt him any longer, you foul beast!” 

“You are the one who is corrupt.”, a voice whispered in his ear. 

He knew that voice, but it was too late to say anything. Darkness encased his vision. The king was knocked unconscious and now laying on the floor. The prince rushed to his mother. 

“My boy, my sweet adventurous boy.” 

Those were the last words he heard from his mother as she slowly died in his arms. He then walked over to his father and tied him to a chair. The King was still unconscious when the prince walked out of the room. 

“No one goes in or out of this room until I say so.”, he proclaimed.

The prince went back into the room and picked up his father's sword. The king woke up finding himself tied up to a chair. 

“You can untie me now, my son.” 

“Your son? Your son is dead. He died with his brothers. Butchered, mutilated, and probably tortured too. You are no father of mine or even a king.” 

The prince's voice was cold and bitter. He observed the elven blade. As the king began to speak, the prince chopped his father's head off.

The prince walked out of the room bloody and emotionless. It was his time to rule.

    Darkness rose from the horizon. The taste of blood through every breath. Power surging through the veins of a warrior, an outcast. He did not hold back this time. His opponent was destroyed in a flash. 
The warrior showed no mercy. Rage, anger, focus, energy. All emotions at once. Using his forbidden powers, he felt like a god, a deity. Nothing could stop him. No more witnesses, no more knowledge of him ever being an outcast.


“My King, we've lost our left flank!” 

“Come again?”, the king questioned his general. 

“We managed to find a single survivor.” 

“Bring him to me, and general?”, the king asked. 

“Yes milord?” 

“Try to keep peace with him.” 

“As you wish, sire.” 

The General gestured for his men to bring the survivor into the tent. 

“Here he is, sire. He hasn't said a word since”, the general proclaimed. 
“Hmm, it seems he is in shock. Do you know where you are?”, the king asked patiently. 

The survivor looked up at the king and nodded, “Yes”.

“Good, do you know who I am?” 

This time the aura of the survivor had changed. The air went cold. The survivor answered. 

“Dead.” 

A few days had passed since the massacre of King Norvack and his army. The survivor continued his warpath and ended up in a distant town.

“Where did you say you were from?”, a barkeep asked. 

“Beyond the mountains of Lydura.” 

“Lydura? Haven't heard that name for many moons. Those lands were once ruled by House Brakka. One of the last houses that came from Brakkaria. Before they became a myth of course.” 

“Those Brakkarians, letting a prophecy destroy a whole civilization.”, the barkeep said. 

“True.”, the patron responded while taking a swig of his ale. 

“The prophecy hasn't come true yet. It is said that a son from House Brakka would rule a far away city.” 

“Huh, I never heard that part of the story.”, the barkeep said. 

“Well lad, would love to chat more, but I have more patrons to serve. Good luck to you and enjoy the rest of your stay, cheers!”

The patron finishes his ale, tosses a few schill on the bar top, and walks outside. The night was pitch black. 

He stares up into the night sky and takes a deep breath, “Now, let's get this party started.” 

The patron lights a torch and throws it up into the air.

“That's the signal, let's go.” 

Soldiers surrounded the tavern. The patron went back inside and found the barkeep prepared to fight, wielding a sword and armor.  

“I am impressed it took you this long to find me.” 

“Your days of hiding are over!”, the patron yelled as he pulled out his sword.

“This is just the beginning, and that prophecy, let's just say it's already in motion.” 

The sword lit up with a dark blue aura. The Knight King's reign of power had just begun…

…After the blast of the great crystal, talk came from all across Seridyl of townsfolk stumbling upon glowing rock like material scattered across their land.  No one knew what they were or where they came from, except the few members present during the ritual under the citadel.
    
Most of the townsfolk kept these relics and hid them away from the outside world, while others sold them to merchants for small amounts of SCHIL.  The leaders of the four factions sought out these mysterious materials in hopes to garner the power from within.  Towns were raided and destroyed as the hunt continued for this precious material.
    
As more material was gathered, leaders soon realized there were more than one type of “shard”.  Obtaining multiple shards seemed to [REDACTED], especially if they were of the same type.
    
Word quickly spread across Seridyl of one man who was able to successfully [REDACTED].  Unfortunately, no one ever saw him after that…
