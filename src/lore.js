    text: `Eons ago, Elves, Knights, Wizards, and Goblins all thrived together within the metaverse. All was great until the Mighty Storm of the Brakkens. Nasty creatures the Brakkens were. Some say the Brakkens were constructed to bring destruction among the four factions.

It was once said that the tower of Raeyn held ancient scripts of the Creators. Atop the tower, a young mage attempted a tracing spell, but nothing happened. He tried again, and again, and again.

“Rats!” He yelled out, unintentionally throwing the spell book down the tower. 

When suddenly, the spell took hold. The trail of the spell pursued the book as it descended into a pit of darkness. 

“Great…”.
    
The young mage used his magic to lower himself down to the bottom of the tower. Touching down on the tower floor, he carefully picked up the spell book. 

When out of the shadows a voice spoke, “Are you here to finally slay me down?”. 

The young mage couldn't comprehend where the voice was coming from. 

“Well…are you still there?”, the voice said. 

The young mage cast a spell to illuminate the surrounding area. An enormous creature stood before him. One he had never seen before. It was magnificent. 

Finding his voice the young mage asked, “Who are you, and what are you hiding from?”. 

“It's a long story”, the creature explained…
    
A few days passed, and the young mage had finally arrived back to the citadel. The aura around him was different. Later that night, he gathered the leaders of the four factions in the bottom of the citadel. A huge crystal could be seen levitating in the middle of the room.
    
The young mage explained to them why they were all gathered together. And one by one, the leaders placed their hands on the face of the crystal. The crystal began to whir and glow ever brighter. As the young mage began chanting, sparks and bolts of light were emitted from the crystal.
    
Suddenly the crystal let out an enormous blast that tossed the leaders viliantly against the walls. Everything had gone dark. A massive wave of energy had escaped through the citadel.  The young mage bolted up the stairs to the top of the citadel. Faint screams could be heard coming from within the city's walls. Smoke and flames engulfed the city. The young mage couldn't comprehend what had happened. 

“I swore I did it right, unless. . .”.  

He soon realized the ancient power he had just unleashed.
    
A noise could be heard from behind him.  A shadowy figure had come barreling towards him.  Before he could jump out of the way, he was knocked unconscious and lay silent on the top of the citadel.
    
The young mage woke up with a gasp, expecting to see the entire world turned to ash. To his surprise everything seemed to still be intact.  

“But I swear I saw…”.  

It must have been a dream, but it seemed so real.
    
After taking some time to rest, he decided to rush down to the bottom of the citadel to ensure the crystal was still there.  

This is where our story begins…

    text: `The lost lands of Brakkaria were only a myth until the Brakkens resurfaced. A mystical land that contained many riches and power. A sacred place created from floating islands in the sky. A beautiful civilization with no care in the world. 

All was great in Brakkaria until greed flooded the lands. Many leaders from far away lands wanted their power and riches for themselves. Destruction plagued Brakkaria until the leader of the Brakkarian army finally had enough. He brought down his mighty hammer, and took out the parasitic leaders one by one. 
    
Outraged by this invasive act, the Brakkarian leader invaded their rival's land, and took them by force. Brakkaria then grew ever larger. His dominance and brave leadership over these lands gave the residents more confidence and insurance over their leader's power.  Brakkaria was now thriving more than ever, and no one dared to tempt their might ever again. 
    
In the dungeon of one of the besieged strongholds, a man lay shackled inside a steel cage with some strange markings engraved on it.  The Brakkarian leader was told this man held knowledge to an ancient power, and that he must meet with him at once.  
    
As he approached the cage, a voice spoke, “It seems the prophecy has begun.  You will become a very powerful and mystic being”. 
    
The Brakkarian leader studied the man. 
    
“Prophecy? Mystic being? Who are you and why do you say such things?”, he said.
    
“I'm not from this plane of existence. I'm merely an ancient spectacle from a distant land.”, the man replied.
    
“The prophecy tells of one true leader.  One to rule them all.  No more war, just peace.”
    
“It says so in that book on the table over there.”, he said as he gestured towards a small wooden table in the corner of the dungeon.
    
The Brakkarian leader walked over and gingerly picked up the book. The title was faded and unreadable. He opened up the book and began to read. At that moment, the engraved symbols on the cage disappeared, and the prisoner's chains unlocked. 
    
“Ahh, that's better. Now let's discuss this prophecy.”
